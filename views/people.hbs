    <h2>Kimarie Yap</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Kimarie is studying environmental science with a minor in social justice
      at St. John's University. She works as an environmental educator for City
      Parks Foundation. Her first Pokemon games were Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow
      for her Gameboy Color and Pokemon Stadium for the N64. One of her best (worst)
      childhood memories is playing Pokemon in the car for long periods of time
      until she got carsick and had to throw up in a bag. Fast forward some years
      and she had the honor of being the first secretary of Pokemon club!</p>
